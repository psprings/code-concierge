# code-concierge

This is a supplemental binary for a code-server environment which will automate fetching dependencies for a GitHub repo to set up a remote text editor/workstation.

## Concept

Given a code-server Docker image and a GitHub repo URL, identify the language(s) and download/install useful extensions for VS Code,
install binaries for development, and clone the repository.
